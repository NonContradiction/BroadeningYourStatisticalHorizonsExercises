# BroadeningYourStatisticalHorizonsExercises
This is a collection of lightly edited solutions I wrote to exercises in the text book Broadening Your Statistical Horizons (2019). The book is viewable here: https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/

These exercises were originally completed in a course taught by Dr. Chris Morrell pursuant to my Loyola University MD M.S. degree in Data Science.
